# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).

* GAN is a pair of 2 Neural Network(Discriminator and Generator) that try to fool each other and thus learning together.  
* Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process.
* A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.
* Training stops when discriminator identifies a fake image as real one.

## Project:
A series of anime images were produced by the generator as it was trained for 40 epochs. The images begin as random noise, and increasingly resemble the anime images over time.
